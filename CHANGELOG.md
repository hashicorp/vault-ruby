## v0.8.0 (March 3, 2017)

BREAKING CHANGES

- Use PUT/POST for all functions that involve tokens [GH-117]. For Vault 0.6+,
  this will work as-expected. For older Vault versions, you will need to use an
  older client library which uses the URL instead. This is deprecated in Vault
  because the URL would include the token, thus revealing it in request logs.
  These new methods place the token in the body instead.

BUG FIXES

- Do not convert arrays in `#to_h` [GH-125]
- Prevent mismatched checkout/checkin from the connection pool; this will avoid masking errors that occur on pool checkout.

- Add support for `#hostname` for specifying SNI hostname to validate [GH-112]

## v0.7.2 (October 24, 2016)

BUG FIXES

- Set the default pool size to 16 rather than calculating from
  the number of available file descriptors.

## v0.7.1 (October 21, 2016)

BUG FIXES
