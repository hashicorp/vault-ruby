Missing Vault token! I cannot make requests to Vault without a token. Please
set a Vault token in the client:

or authenticate with Vault using the Vault CLI:

    $ vault auth ...

or set the environment variable $VAULT_TOKEN to the token value:

    $ export VAULT_TOKEN="..."

Please refer to the documentation for more examples.
